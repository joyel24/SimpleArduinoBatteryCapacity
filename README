Simple Battery Capacity Tester using Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro and 32x128 SSD1306 OLED screen

PINS connections :
  SSD1306 Oled Display
    SDA -> PIN2
    SCK -> PIN3

You can access the menu when discharge is off by clicking the pushbutton.

To Do :
- [OK] Add feature to store data in EEPROM to keep data even after reset or unwanted poweroff
- [OK] Add Menu
- [OK] Erase EEPROM via menu caapability
- [OK] Try to implement battery internal Resistance calculator
- [OK] fix time shifting toooo much
- Add Wh counter
- Add max intensity parameter to prevent from short circuit or load resistance too low
- Add History function
- Connect & control Buck to charge ?
- Make readable schematics (my draft paper is very ugly)
